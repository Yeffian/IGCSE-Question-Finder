https://igcse-question-finder.streamlit.app/

This is a quick tool I whipped up to find question papers and mark schemes based on the subject, year, etc

### Features:
- Retrieve all IGCSE Papers ✅
- Retrive all AS/A Level Papers ❌
- Get from different exam boards (OCR, WJEC, Edexcel) ❌
- Retrieve different variants of the same paper ✅

The papers are all scraped from https://papacambridge.com/
